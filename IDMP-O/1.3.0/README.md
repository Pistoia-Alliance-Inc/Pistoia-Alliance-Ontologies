The IDMP Ontology (IDMP-O) 1.3 release, the second public release of the ontology, consists of an abridged, combined version of a number of the project ontologies. It covers aspects of (1) ISO-21090 - Health informatics - Harmonized data types for information interchange, (2) ISO-11240 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of units of measurement, (3) ISO-11238 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of regulated information on substances, and (4) ISO-11615 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of regulated medicinal product information, as required to support the use cases identified by project stakeholders as of the publication date. 

Significant additional content was added to the IDMP-O ontologies in the Q3 2024, 1.3 release. New material covers parts of the ISO 11615 standard related to marketing authorizations, marketing status, manufacturing authorizations, manufacturers, manufacturing / business operations and related concepts. These additions were made primarily to address new use cases, but have increased our coverage of the ISO standard at the same time in preparation for referencing the ontology in the ISO standards themselves. In addition, we have addressed numerous bug fixes and inconsistencies identified through existing and newly added hygiene testing, thereby increasing the quality of the ontologies.

The merged ontology includes content from six individual ontologies that comprise the IDMP-O release, combined for ease of public use, and that extend or reference the following:
   - Dublin Core Metadata Terms - http://purl.org/dc/terms/ (referenced, not imported)
   - Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) - http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# (referenced, not imported)
   - Commons Ontology Library from the Object Management Group (OMG) - https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/ (imported, 22 ontologies from the library)

Note that these ontologies are not included in the uploaded, combined IDMP-O ontology, but rather can be found by 'following your nose'.
